List of libraries:
Before beginning our work, we install all the necessary packages required for our code to render perfectly without any errors. Packages we are installing:

Pandas- Used for data manipulation with indexing.
Scikit-learn- Used for Data analysis and Data mining. It consists of ML algorithms.
NLTK- To process Natural Language Processing (NLP) code.
Seaborn- Library based on Matplotlib to draw statistic graphics.
Langid- Language identification tool.

Now, we import entire modules or specific objects from a module into your notebook:

Numpy- Used for numerical operations
Matplotlib.pyplot- A versatile plotting library.
re- Used for regular expressions
train_test_split- Used to split data into training and testing sets.
CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer- To convert text data into numerical feature vectors.
StandardScale- Used for Feature scaling.
LabelEncoder- Used for encoding categorical labels.
RandomForest- An ensemble learning method for Classification.
PC((Principal Component Analysis)-Used for dimensionality reduction.
Accuracy_score, Classification_report, Confusion_matrix, roc_curve, auc- Function used to evaluate the performance of a ML model.
rt - The Support Vector Classification algorithm.
Make_pipeline- Used to create a pipeline for sequential application of a list of transforms with a final estimator.
Axes3D- Used to create 3D plots using Matplotlib.
GradientBoostingClassifier- Implements the Gradient boosting algorithm for classification tasks.
